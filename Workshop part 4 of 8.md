Storage Spaces Direct
---------------------

>   You are to configure S2D on at least two virtual Server 2019 servers (not
>   the DC’s). Use the server SVR1 and SVR2 as some of the servers - SVR3
>   (server core) as an additional. Remember that SVR2 needs domain membership -
>   and both SVR2 and SVR3 needs additional disks.
