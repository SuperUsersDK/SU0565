Storage Migration Service
-------------------------

>   You are to make sure that one virtual member server is running as a file
>   server with shares, permissions and files. Configure another member server
>   (SVR1 or SVR2) as both destination and orchestrator server.  
>   SVR7 is a prepared Server 2008R2 with Domain membership and the File Server
>   Role and some Fileshares and files.

>   Run everything through Windows Admin Center.

>   Test after migration that permissions on shares and file system is correct
>   on destination server.

>   When done â€“ do **not** revert virtual machines to Checkpoint.
